    <h1>Konichiwa!</h1>
    <h3>Hajmemashite. Watashi wa Rishita-san. </h3>
    <p>I am Rishita. I was born on 25th of July, in a place I will not mention, because I don't want to. I do not have any legendary background story involving losing 50 limbs, or being in the army, or having a chronic disease which renders me unable to do anything, etc. I like reading, watching and playing Danganronpa, a trilogy which has 4 games, two animes, and many novels. Another one of my favourite trilogies is Ace Attorney, which has numerous games in it. My favourite book seies are Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys, The Secry Sequence, etc. I am a huge fan of anime, my favourites being Death Note, My Hero Academia, That Time I was Reincarnted as Slime, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Arte, etc. As you may have noticed, a lot of my favourites are Crime Fiction- related. Yeah, its my favourite. For some reason, I am intrigued by western fashion history, especially the Victorian and Edwardian eras. I want to be a Detective or a fashion historian when I grow up, just like Nancy Drew, and Kyoko Kirigiri. If you think that is lame, I don't care. You can't make me stop. Hahahaha (In Rimuru Tempest's Voice).  </p>````
